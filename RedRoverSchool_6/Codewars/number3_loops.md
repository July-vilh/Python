1) Expected Behaviour

Function should return a dictionary/Object/Hash with "status" as a key, whose value can : "busy" or "available" depending on the truth value of the argument is_busy.

But as you will see after clicking RUN or ATTEMPT this code has several bugs, please fix them.

```
def get_status(is_busy):
    n = "busy" if is_busy elese "available"
    dict = {"status":n}
    return n
 ```
